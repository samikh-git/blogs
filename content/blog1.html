        <p> Tuesday April 22, 2025  </p>
        <p> I have been following the <a href = "https://course.fast.ai/"> Fast AI </a>course on deep learning to begin understanding the technical details of these important concepts. The purpose of these blogs, for now, will be to summarize my learnings, share insights, ask open-ended questions, and any other educative use I can derive from this. </p>

        <h2> What is deep learning? </h2>
        <p> To answer this question, it is first necessary to see what we mean by machine learning. Machine learning is a non-deterministic form of computing. We are not formally writing out each step that our computer must take to produce the output we request. We are "training" our computers/models to produce results that are useful. </p>
        <p> Deep learning is a particular subset of machine learning that uses deep neural networks. Neural networks use </p>
